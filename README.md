This project provides a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) of student academic performance through an interactive Streamlit dashboard and a dedicated HTML/CSS landing page. The analysis focuses on key academic indicators such as attendance, internal assessment scores, assignment performance, study habits, and final examination results. The Streamlit application enables dynamic exploration of the dataset by presenting statistical summaries, visualizing distributions, identifying missing values, examining correlations, and detecting outliers using standard analytical techniques. The accompanying HTML website serves as a clean and modern introduction to the project, offering a structured overview and visual preview of the dashboard. Overall, this project aims to support data-driven insights into student performance patterns and provide an accessible analytical tool for educators, learners, and researchers.
